> **P**ull request **I**n **T**est — a pit stop for code review.

Pull requests get reviewed as text diffs. Anything that only appears at
runtime — layout, error states, form validation, how a screen behaves with no
data — stays invisible to the reviewer.

`pit` brings up the running state of a pull request on the reviewer's own
machine: one command, isolated from their work in progress, with the right test
data loaded, and torn down without a trace by a second command. A review you can
operate, not just read.

Written in Go. Runs locally on Docker. No cloud account required.

## Status

Early development — not usable yet. Full documentation will follow once the tool
does something worth documenting.

Outside contributions are not being accepted at this time.
